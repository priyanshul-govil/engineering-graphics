# Projection of Lines
This a simple C++ application on projection of lines in engineering graphics.

The program takes as input the True Length, Angle with HP (theta), and Angle with VP (phi) of the line, and outputs-
1.  Front View Length
2.  Top View Length
3.  Apparent Angle with HP (alpha)
4.  Apparent Angle with VP (beta)

The aim of this program is to help you find the characteristics of the line in its projection, to a fine accuracy. This helps in checking your answers, and help in projection as well.
